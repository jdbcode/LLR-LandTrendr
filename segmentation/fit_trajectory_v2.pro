;given a set of years and observed values,
;   fit the trajectory using segmentation.
;  Use a simple segmentation approach where the segments
;      vertices are assigned in order from early to latest
;      year.
;  If that doesn't produce a reasonable fit at pval threshold,
;	   then try a segmentation that allows all vertex values
;	   to float independently (more timeconsuming)
;Ouputs:
;	 A structure with enough room for information on the
;		year and the value of 6 vertices (which is currently the
;		most that are reasonable in the landsat record).

;Years:  the year values that are to be used in the fitting.
; 		These should have the same number of elements as the vvals
;		array.  These should not include years that have clouds
;		or any other filtered values.
;VVals:  The values (spectral, biomass, etc.) for the Years.
;Allyears:  The years for the entire sequence of images, including
;		the years that have been masked out for the fitting.
;		This allows us to build a true fitted image even for
;		years where there's a cloud, etc.



;get the offset of years.  add back in at the end
