; NAME:
;       ONE2TWO
; PURPOSE:
;       Convert from 1-d indices to 2-d indices.
; CATEGORY:
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       one2two, in, arr, ix, iy
; INPUTS:
;       in = 1-d indices (may be a scalar).  in
;       arr = array to use (for size only).  in
;         Alternatively, arr can be [nx, ny]
;         where nx and ny are the image sizes
;         in x and y (saves space).
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; OUTPUTS:
;       ix, iy = equivalent 2-d indices.     out
; COMMON BLOCKS:
; NOTES:
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       R. Sterner, 25 May, 1986.
;       Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.
;       R. Sterner, 19 Nov, 1989 --- converted to SUN.
;       R. Sterner, 9 Jun, 1993 --- Allowed [nx,ny] instead of ARR.
