; NAME:
;	FAST_UNIQUE
; PURPOSE:
;	Faster version of UNIQUE - at least it's faster at large reductions.
;	If the unique version of the array is much smaller than the original,
;	then this is faster than UNIQUE.
;	Also, FAST_UNIQUE will work on COMPLEX arrays.
;	Also, FAST_UNIQUE does not sort the result.
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	result = FAST_UNIQUE( array )
; INPUTS:
;	array - An array to unique.
; OUTPUTS:
;	result - The uniqued array.  A version of array that has all 
;		duplicate elements removed.
; RESTRICTIONS:
;	Dose not work with structures.
; PROCEDURE:
;	Repeatedly remove duplicate elements from array, saving only one copy.
;-
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;	Based on source in TIPS.  Updated for User Lib by D. Landers, May 95


FUNCTION fast_unique, array

	notequal = WHERE( a  NE a(0) )
	IF ( notequal(0) eq -1 ) THEN RETURN, unq(1:*)
