function conv_signed8bit_to_int, val

;convert a signed 8bit value from Imagine to a 16 bit value for IDL
;the 128 value bit is 1 for negative, so we shift down to that bit
;  only (ishft(val,-7)), multiply by 2, subtract 1 to get -1 for input
;  of 0 and 1 for input of 1, then multiply by -1 to get the sign of 
;  the bits.  Then multiply by the rest of the value (the other seven
;  bits, with the high_mask(val,1) covering the 1st bit.
;
;Signed 8bit goes from -128 to + 127
;    If the first bit is set, then it's -128 + the value
