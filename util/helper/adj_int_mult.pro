function adj_int_mult, upper_left, pixel_size, candidate_value, map=map

;PURPOSE:  returns the candidate value adjusted to an integer multiple of
;     pixels away from the upperleft pixel. If upper_left is center of pixel,
;     then the returned value will also be center of pixel.  If upper_left
;     is corner of pixel, the returned value will also be corner.
;ASSUMPTIONS:  both upper_left and candidate_value are in file coordinate system
;
;RULE:  half-way points moved up and to the left
;Rules:
;map
;x: -.49 to .5 --> 0    .51 to 1.5 --> 1
;y: -.5 to .49 --> 0    -.51 to -1.5 --> -1
;regular
;x:  -.49 to .5 --> 0  .51 to 1.5 --> 1
;y:  -.49 to .5 --> 0  .51 to 1.5 --> 1


if n_elements(map) eq 0 then mapadj = [1,1] else $
	if map eq 0 then mapadj = [1,1] else mapadj = [1,-1]


pixels = ( double(candidate_value) - upper_left ) / (pixel_size*mapadj)


return, [ (ceil(pixels(0)-0.5)*pixel_size(0))+upper_left(0), $
	  (mapadj(1)*ceil(pixels(1)-0.5)*pixel_size(1))+upper_left(1) ]
end


;March 5th, 1998changed assumption to not in map coords, so you ned to set
;  /map to have it work like before.  I've checked this for the following
;  programs:  fix_edge.function, squeeter, squeeter_procbundle,
;		calc_rot_vector, edgit.function, covar, pick_gcps.pro,
;		aggby, squeet.pro, squeet_handler.pro, squeet_procbundle
