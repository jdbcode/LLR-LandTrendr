function sq_rotate, inp, angle, interp=interp

  ;rotate the two images relative to each other.
  ;   angle of rotation clockwise from due north
  ;   rs- the structure including the reference image
  ;   is-   "    " 	     "     "    input     "

if n_elements(interp) ne 0 then $
    new_image = rot(inp.img, angle, /interp, missing=inp.img_info.ignore) else $
    new_image = rot(inp.img, angle, missing = inp.img_info.ignore)



  ;get new values for the corners (center stays the same)
  ;  see page 67, bottom for information on rationale for doing this.
  ;  But basically, if we rotate the original image clockwise 30 degrees,
  ;  we want to know what the new upper left corner is in the coordinate
  ;  system of the original image.  The easiest way to think of this is
  ;  to envision the upper left of the original image turning back
  ;  (counterclockwise) 30 degrees.  The way to calculate that is
  ;  just use the negative of the angle that the user gives


    ;first, get a dx, dy from center to original edge
      diff_upl = inp.img_info.centerpoint - inp.img_info.upl
      diff_lor = inp.img_info.centerpoint - inp.img_info.lor

    ;then get a new dx, dy for the rotated edges

      new_diff_upl = calc_rot_vect(-angle)##diff_upl
      new_diff_lor = calc_rot_vect(-angle)##diff_lor

    ;now add back to centerpoint

      nupl = inp.img_info.centerpoint - new_diff_upl
      nlor = inp.img_info.centerpoint - new_diff_lor

  ;return the image with new information

     img_info = {filename:inp.img_info.filename, upl:nupl, lor:nlor, $
          pixelsize:inp.img_info.pixelsize, centerpoint:inp.img_info.centerpoint, $
          layer:inp.img_info.layer, gifov:inp.img_info.gifov, $
          ignore:inp.img_info.ignore}
     ret = {img:new_image, img_info:img_info, offset:inp.offset, $
    		valid:inp.valid}

   return, ret
