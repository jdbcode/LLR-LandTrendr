function edgit, coordinate, pixel_size, tocenter=tocenter, $
	lowerright=lowerright, map=map

;Purpose:  adjust coordinates to centers or edges of pixel, given the 
; other

;Default mode:  Given the center point and pixel size, the function returns 
;		the upper left corner of the pixel.  
;/tocenter:  the coordinate given to the program is the upper left edge, so the
;		program returns the center value.
;/lowerright:  toggles either or both of the other options so that the 
;		lower right edge is considered.  In other words, if /tocenter
;		is chosen with /lowerright, the coordinate value given by
;		user is assumed to be the lowerright of the pixel.  If 
;		/tocenter is not chosen, then the user-defined coordinate is
;		assumed to be the center and the lowerright is returned.


if n_elements(tocenter) ne 0 then adj = [-.5,.5] else adj = [.5,-.5]
if n_elements(lowerright) ne 0 then adj = adj*[-1,-1]
if n_elements(map) eq 0 then adj = adj*[1,-1] else $
	if map eq 0 then adj = adj*[1,-1] ;alter the y if not using map


return, coordinate - (pixel_size*adj)
end

;added /map command so that non-map coordinates could be calc'd.  I checked
;  all the relevant programs and added the /map command where appropriate.
