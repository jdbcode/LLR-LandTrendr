function matchstr, stringarray, search_string, match_case=match_case, $

;Find any places where any part of string array the entire search
;   string match up, or where any part of the search string and one
;   or more of the full elements of the stringarry match up.

;
;total_match means that the search_string must match the entire
;   element of the string vector, not just a piece of it.
;   this is useful if you're just searching for an identical
;   match in a string array.



 s = size(stringarray)
  if s(0) eq 0 then return, -1
  if size(stringarray, /type) ne 7 then return, -1  ;if not a string
  if strlen(search_string) eq 0 then return, -1     ;for empty strings

  if n_elements(match_case) eq 0 then match_case = 0



  matchcount = 0
  n=n_elements(stringarray)

;if we're matching the entire string in both, then it's easy.
;  do it and return quickly

if n_elements(total_match) ne 0 then begin
  matches = bytarr(n)
  if match_case eq 0 then $
     for i = 0,n-1 do matches[i] = (strupcase(stringarray[i]) eq strupcase(search_string)) else $
     for i = 0,n-1 do matches[i] = stringarray[i] eq search_string
  pos = where(matches eq 1, many)
  return, pos
end

;otherwise, need to search in both directions.
;First, search through the string array for the search string


  for i = 0,n-1 do begin
     if match_case eq 0 then $
       a = strpos(strupcase(stringarray(i)), strupcase(search_string)) else $
       a = strpos(stringarray(i), search_string)

     if a ne -1 then begin
      if matchcount eq 0 then $
            pos= lonarr(1) else expand_cols, pos, 1, newdims
       pos(matchcount) = i
       matchcount=matchcount+1
     end

   end


;Second, search through the string for components that are in the string array

for i = 0,n-1 do begin
  if match_case eq 0 then $
       a = strpos(strupcase(search_string), strupcase(stringarray[i])) else $
       a = strpos(search_string, stringarray[i])

  if strlen(stringarray[i]) eq 0 then a = -1	;have special case of blank parts of string array
  					;that would match with anything. so need to avoid them.


  if a ne -1 then begin
    if matchcount eq 0 then $
        pos= lonarr(1) else expand_cols, pos, 1, newdims
    pos(matchcount) = i
    matchcount = matchcount+1
  end

end


;There's a chance that we could double up on the same index, so we need
;   to take out double hits.  Also, if we have no hits, return, -1


if matchcount ne 0 then ind = pos(uniq(pos)) else ind = [-1]

return, ind
end
