function calc_rot_vect, ang, rad=rad

;This function returns a (2,2) array of x,y coefficients to 
;   translate map coordinates in the an unrotated image to 
;   map coordinates in the rotated image.
;The returned vector - rot_vect	[a,b]
;				[c,d]
;works as follows:
;   Given an offset in the original map coordinate system -  [x, y],
;   where x is easting and y is northing, the offset in the 
;   rotated system is :   (xrot,yrot) = calc_rot_vect(ang)##[x,y]
;
;We assume values in degrees (requiring a change to radians before using
;	trig functions), but can handle rads if user specifies by 
;	simply not transforming.
;
;Angle is in degrees clockwise from north; i.e. if the rotated coordinate
;	system is oriented toward northeast, then angle would be +45.0

if n_elements(rad) eq 0 then angle = ang*!dtor else angle=ang
return,  [ [cos(angle), sin(angle)], [-sin(angle), cos(angle)] ]
end
