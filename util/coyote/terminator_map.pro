; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       Terminator_Map, center_lon, center_lat, Map_Projection='Aitoff'
;
; INPUT ARGUMENTS:
;
;       center_lon:      The longitude, in degrees, of the center of the map, (-180 to 180). Defaults to 0.0.
;
;       center_lat:      The latitude, in degrees, of the center of the map, (-90 to 90). Defaults to 0.0.
;                        Latitudes other than zero can cause program problems. See the NOTES section for details.
;
; INPUT KEYWORDS:
;
;       FLIPDAY:         The program suffers from an inability to always correctly distinguish the
;                        "day" side of the day/night terminator (see NOTES section). If the program
;                        gets it wrong, you can use this keyword to "flip" the day/night area. For
;                        example, here is a call that gets it wrong:
;
;                            Terminator_Map, 0, 90.0, MAP_PROJECTION=4, time="Thu Apr 13 08:49:34 2006"
;
;                        Unfortunately, you can only know if it is "wrong" by visual inspection. The sun
;                        is always placed correctly. I realize this limits the usefulness of the program,
;                        generally, but it is a limitation I am not motivated enough to fix. That is to
;                        say, the program meets my limited needs perfectly. :-)
;
;       KEEP_ASPECT:     If set, the aspect ratio of the map is more or less preserved.
;
;       MAP_PROJECTION:  Either the number or the name of one of the following map projection types. Defaults to "CYLINDRICAL".
;                        0 CYLINDRICAL
;                        1 GOODESHOMOLOSINE
;                        2 HAMMER
;                        3 LAMBERT
;                        4 MERCATOR
;                        5 MILLER_CYLINDRICAL
;                        6 MOLLWEIDE
;                        7 ROBINSON
;
;      TIME:             A date/time string of nearly any format. The month, however, should be represented
;                        as a three-letter string. The time is written as hh:mm:ss. Examples of date/time strings
;                        are these:
;
;                        'Wed Apr 12 22:39:52 2006'
;                        '12 APR 2006 04:16:00'
;                        'Apr 12, 2006 04:16:00'
;                        'Nov 12, 2006'
;
;                        If undefined, the current day and time (from SYSTIME) is used.
;
; OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
;
;       IMAGE:           If passed a named variable, will return a 24-bit image of the result in the display window.
;
; DEPENDENCIES:
;
;       Requires both the Coyote Library and the JHUAPL Library to be on the !PATH, since many programs
;       from both are used.

;
; EXAMPLE:
;
;          Window, XSize=800, YSize=400
;          Terminator_Map
;
; NOTES:
;
;       The spherical geometry problems inherent with working the map projections are not
;       completely solved in this program. The main problem seems to be that if the
;       terminator polygon (represented in the program by the variables lon_terminus
;       and lat_terminus) overlaps the pole regions, then stardard methods for determining
;       if a point is inside or outside a polygon are not reliable. (*All* longitudes are
;       inside the polygon if the polygon overlaps a pole!) In the program, this manifests
;       itself as the sun side of the terminator appearing dark and the night side appearing
;       light. Hence, the FLIPDAY keyword.
;
;       To some extent, this problem can be eliminated by setting the CENTER_LAT parameter
;       to zero, at least with some map projections. I've thought about forcing it to be
;       zero and forcing you to use well-behaved map projections, but have decided to leave
;       the program the way it is so you can discover the limitations yourself.
