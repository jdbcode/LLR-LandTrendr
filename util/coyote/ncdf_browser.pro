; NAME:
;       NCDF_BROWSER
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       This program is designed to make it easier to browse
;       and read the data and metadata in netCDF files. The user
;       can browse files, and read the data and metadata into
;       main-level IDL variables. New netCDF files can be opened
;       at any time. The user interacts with the program via a
;       graphical user interface (GUI).

; CATEGORY:

;       File I/O
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;       IDL> NCDF_Browser, filename
;
; Arguments:
;
;       filename: The name of a netCDF file to open and browse.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;       
;       EXTENSION: In general, netCDF files use *.nc, *.ncf, or *.ncdf file extensions to
;                  identify themselves as netCDF files. Some users have their own file extensions.
;                  You can use this keyword to identify the file extension you wish to use. If
;                  set here, it will be used as the file filter in place of the normal file 
;                  extensions in DIALOG_PICKFILE.
;
;                      obj = ('NCDF_DATA', file, EXTENSION='*.bin')
;
; NOTES:
;       
;       This program is only a (useful) front-end for a more flexible
;       object program of class NCDF_DATA. In this front end, the NCDF_DATA
;       object is created and then destroyed when the GUI is destroyed.
;       The NCDF_DATA object can be used to read netCDF data in a non-interactive
;       way, if you prefer not to use a GUI to interact with the data file.
;
; REQUIRES:
;
;        The following programs are required from the Coyote Library.

;           Andrew Slater, and Paul van Delst.
;       Added Extension keyword. DWF. 04 Feb 2008.
